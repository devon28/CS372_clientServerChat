questions where server binds to local host then a client connects. The server side
# picks a person place thing etc for the client side to try to guess, the client has
# 20 questions to figure it out. If the client does not correctly guess then the server
# side wins and if the client correclty guesses the client wins. There are prompting 
# messages throughout to make things simple. The focus here is on sockets and client server
# interactions
